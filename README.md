# body-improvement

The body impovement club is purposed to serve as the 'Steam' version of weightlifting programs. Post your favorite program, and look for other lifter's programms in the workshop!

The project will resemble the Steam Workshop, where you can post your favorite program, and look for other lifter's programms. The backend of the project is done in Spring Boot, and the frontend is done in React, front end repo is [HERE](https://github.com/Extrieve/body-improvement-react)

### Status
The current status of the project is that the Spring Boot backend side is almost done, and the React frontend is in the works. The missing portions of the backend are JWT authentication and unit tests. The frontend is just starting, and I will be using the React-Bootstrap library to make the frontend look nice.

I will keep updating this README as the project progresses.
